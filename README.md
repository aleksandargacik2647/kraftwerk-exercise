<h1>Kraftwerk exercise</h1>
<h3>Frontend exercise</h3>
<p>For this exercise I coded the two given responsive screens. Also, I made sure that they also work on mobile phones. For this exercise, the form does not need to be validated and the data does not need to be sent. The form is accessible via the keyboard and the exercise is working in the most common browsers. The country selectâ€™s options contain all countries of the world and are populated dynamically with an API call to https://restcountries.eu/. As a bonus I used the Gulp taskrunner for SASS preprocessor and other plugins for the minification and optimization of the resources.</p>
